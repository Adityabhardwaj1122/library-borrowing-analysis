# Library Borrowing Analysis

This project analyzes borrowing patterns and demographic trends using transaction data from a library. It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization using R and ggplot2, and summary statistics.

## Overview
Libraries collect vast amounts of data on book borrowings, which can reveal insights into reading habits, popular genres, and user demographics. This project dives into such data to uncover patterns and trends that can inform library management and outreach strategies.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, converting data types, and ensuring data integrity.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding distributions, correlations, and outliers in the dataset.
- **Statistical Summaries:** Calculating aggregate statistics such as average borrowing duration, most borrowed books, and demographic breakdowns.
- **Visualizations:** Using ggplot2 to create visual representations of borrowing duration by genre, borrowing frequency by age group and gender, and genre popularity.

## Usage
Clone the repository, install necessary R packages (`tidyverse`, `lubridate`, `ggplot2`), and run the R script to perform data analysis and generate visualizations.
